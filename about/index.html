# ABOUT ME

![](About-Me/selfie.jpg)

My name is Yuyang He. 

### ACADEMIC

I am a fourth-year undergraduate in statistics at [the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/) and I am going to continue my master's study in business analytics at [Columbia University](https://engineering.columbia.edu/). Before graduation, I have been to [the University of Oxford](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/) for the one-year visiting program and [Chung-Ang University](https://www.cau.ac.kr/index.do) for the summer exchange. 

### PROFESSIONAL 

I have interned at Bright Securities, in Shanghai headquarters, where I worked in the Fixed Income Department. My career goal is to combine data analytic skills and business insights to build social value. I plan to work in IBDs or consulting firms. 

### MY INTERESTS

My main interests lie in machine learning and business analytics. I have done projects on machine learning, deep learning, time series and stochastic process with Python, R and MATLAB. I have also realized my ideas into an Android APP with JAVA in Android Studio.  

In my free time, I like to write poems and compose music. I love reading books and writing comments on them. I use my e-BUJO every day.
